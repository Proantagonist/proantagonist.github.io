                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    <p>Shale deposits are the source of considerable oil and gas extraction. In the United States, drilling for oil and gas in shale have supported an increase in oil and gas production, reversing a longstanding decline. In Texas, three main shale deposits support extraction of natural gas. The Barnett Shale is located in and west of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. The Haynesville/Bossier deposit is in east Texas, while the Eagle Ford shale is in south Texas.</p>

                                    <p>Some shale deposits with oil and gas are in rural areas, underneath farms, ranches, and forests. But in several areas, large urban populations are found above shale gas and oil. This poses dilemmas for stakeholders, such as policymakers, the oil and gas industry, residents, and owners of mineral rights.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><a class="popup-youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB3FOJjpy7s">Hydraulic Fracturing - Shale Natural Gas Extraction (2:40)</a></p>

                                    <p>This project focuses on urban drilling in the Barnett shale, a 325 million-year-old deposit underneath 21 counties and covering about 5,000 square miles. The Dallas-Fort Worth urban area has a population of 6.7 million people, the fourth largest metropolitan region in the United States. The Barnett is a highly productive natural gas field. Hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," began in 2003, and was coupled with horizontal drilling. Together, fracking and horizontal drilling have made the Barnett highly attractive to gas firms. In 2000, there were around 500 wells drilled in the Barnett; in 2013, firms had drilled 17,000 wells in the Barnett shale.</p>

                                    <p>Fracking for natural gas presents positive and negative aspects. Supporters argue that fracking is a means to achieve energy independence and generates economic benefits for local populations through increased employment. Opponents of fracking point to high water use in the fracking process, in addition to the destination of benzene and other chemicals used in fracking, which may reach ground and surface water, or may be part of airborne emissions ("Blind Rush," 2011). Many observers point to the as raising public awareness about the possible dangers of fracking (Gasland, 2010); by contrast, representatives of the oil and gas industry argue that "Gasland" promoted dubious claims.</p>
                                    <p>One of the major reasons there is such contention is the absence of research on this activity. Because it is new, it has taken time for researchers to collect enough data to analyze. Until just recently, for example, neither the environmental, health, or economic impacts were understood. Recently the stated regulatory agency for oil in gas, theTexas Railroad Commission rejected the assertion that hydraulic fracturing increased methane in the water supply despite a very divided scientific community (Texas Tribune, 20 June 2014). Therefore, to find information about fracking residents and citizens have been forced to sift through industry-funded studies or anti-fracking activist reports – neither of which provides an objective overview.</p>
                                    <p>Regulation of oil and gas drilling, whether by hydraulic fracturing or conventional drilling technology, exists at federal, state, and municipal levels. At the federal level, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) restricts drilling within 3,000 feet from USACE dams. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) regulates oil and gas exploration, extraction, and production; it determined that gas drilling should be at least 200 feet away from residences; this is known as a setback distance. The Railroad Commission does not regulate impacts of drilling on water, which is the domain of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) because hydraulic fracturing is exempted from the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) due to, what is called, the "Halliburton Loophole," after the company that lobbied extensively for the exemption in the 2005 Energy Bill. The RRC governs the mineral (subsurface) estate. To facilitate mineral development, the state of Texas divides property into two estates: surface and mineral. The RRC governs the mineral estate while home-rule municipalities have authority over surface estates within their jurisdiction</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Municipalities, if they have "home-rule" status, may establish ordinances that regulate surface aspects of gas and oil drilling, such as noise and setback distances. Home rule cities have more than 5,000 residents and have adopted city charters that allow for some legislative and legal autonomy from the state; therefore, home rule cities have authority to regulate oil and gas activities within their jurisdiction.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    In 2001 Fort Worth established a gas drilling ordinance that aimed to "protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public, minimize the potential impact to property and mineral rights owners, protect the quality of the environment and encourage the orderly production of available mineral resources." Fort Worth determined that gas drilling could occur 600 feet from residences. In Denton, the setback distance is 1,200 feet, while it is 1,500 feet in Flower Mound. We have found that there is no uniform setback distance in municipal ordinances, and that setback distances tend to increase over time. Moreover, the high variation among setback distances shows that distance is not a technical determination but rather a political compromise among representatives of hydrocarbon firms, residents, city council staff, and elected municipal officials.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Municipal ordinances for oil and gas are political issues dressed in technical language. One major reason for making ordinances technical is the threat of "regulatory takings." The Texas Supreme Court ruled in 1971 that people who control the mineral estate have rights that trump those who own the surface estate. If the owner of the surface estate prevented access to the mineral estate, they would deprive owners of the oil and gas estate from their right to property. However, the right of estate owners is not absolute. The state has the right to restrict mineral rights to protect public safety, health, and general welfare. If restrictions on the mineral estate are unreasonable or arbitrary, then a "regulatory takings" has occurred. It is not yet clear which setback distance, between wells and residences, may create a "regulatory takings."</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Besides the "regulatory takings" issues, municipal officials (elected councilmembers and mayors, and permanent staff) contend with day-to-day issues, such as permits for gas wells and citizen complaints. Elected officials have opted to create task forces or working groups to draft ordinances that regulate surface issues relating to oil and gas, responding to citizens and industry stakeholders. Ordinances, however, do not prevent the existence of gas wells very near or closer to residences than the setback distance; gas wells permitted before the ordinance are considered "vested interests" and therefore are not subject to new setback distance. Therefore, it is possible for gas wells in Denton to be closer to residences than the municipal ordinance.</p>

                            <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
                            </p>

But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
