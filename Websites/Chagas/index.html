                        OVERVIEW<span>Eco-Epidemiology and Chagas Disease Basics</span>
                    </h1>
                    <p>Many diseases have their origins in nature.  Eco-epidemiology examines the relationship between health and ecology: how animal and human health are affected by ecological factors in the environment.  Studying the eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease in the United States allows us to take a broad approach to better understand the relationships among many different parts of the system, Chagas disease emerges at the intersection of wildlife, domestic animals, humans, and vector populations.</p>

                        THE VECTOR<span>Kissing Bugs</span>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Kissing bugs are nocturnal, blood-feeding insects that are members of the Reduviidae family.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <a href="images/ThreeBugs-original.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/ThreeBugs.jpg" title="Click for high resolution image"></a>
                        <figcaption>Three species of kissing bugs that can be found in Texas. Left to right: <em>Triatoma sanguisuga, Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma protracta</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Other reduviids that are similar in appearance feed on plants and other insects and can inflict a painful bite when disturbed, however only kissing bugs are known to transmit the Chagas parasite. Kissing are found throughout the Americas. In the US, kissing bugs are established in 28 states. A total of 11 different species of kissing bugs have been documented in the US, with the highest diversity and density in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Previous studies have found that, on average, 50% of kissing bugs are infected with the Chagas parasite. Kissing bugs develop into adults after a series of five immature life stages called nymphs, and both nymphs and adults engage in bloodfeeding behavior.</p>
                    <p>Bugs can feed on diverse wild and domestic animals including wild rodents, other wild mammals, domestic dogs, and humans.</p>

                    <h2>
                        THE PARASITE<span>Trypanosoma cruzi</span>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi  can cause Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and other mammals.  Kissing bugs can transmit the parasite to hosts by biting and subsequently defecating near the site of the bite. The parasites live in the digestive tract of the bugs and are shed in the bug feces. When infectious bug fecal material contaminates the mucous membranes or the site of bug bite on a mammal, transmission of the parasite can occur. Alternately, dogs can also become infected through the consumption of infected bugs.  The parasite can be transmitted congenitally, through blood transfusion, and through transplantation of infected organs. Chagas disease is endemic throughout central and South America, and is increasingly recognized as both a human and veterinary health concern in the southern United States. Chagas disease became a reportable disease in Texas in 2013.</p>
                    <p>Wildlife and Domestic Animals-Many different wildlife species are infected with the T. cruzi parasite in nature, and can serve as a source of parasite infection to kissing bugs.  Infected animals in the US include domestic dogs, non-human primates, opossums, woodrats, armadillos, coyotes, mice, raccoons, skunks, and foxes.  Studies have not been conducted to determine if all these species actually suffer from disease when infected, or if they can be silent, unaffected carriers of the parasite.</p>
                    
                    <h2>HUMAN HEALTH<span>Impacts</span></h2>
                    <p>The public health burden of Chagas disease in the US is largely unknown, because most states are not required to keep track of the number of confirmed human cases. Estimates of human cases of Chagas disease in the US range from 300,000 to over 1 million, with particular concern for those living in the US/Mexico border regions. In addition to documented cases in immigrants who were infected in central and South America, there are increasing reports of human cases of Chagas disease acquired in the US.</p>
                    <p>In humans, Chagas disease manifests in two phases: acute phase and chronic phase. After becoming infected with the parasite, the acute phase can last for a few weeks or months. Some humans may never develop acute disease.  Acute phase Chagas disease may be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are common for many types of sicknesses, including fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. Of those who are infected with the parasite, approximately 30% are at risk of developing chronic Chagas disease. Chronic Chagas disease includes cardiac complications and/or intestinal complications, and these signs may not be apparent until decades after the initial infection. Cardiac signs include enlarged heart, heart failure, altered heart rate, and/or cardiac arrest. Intestinal signs include an enlarged esophagus or colon, which can cause difficulties with digestion. Concerned individuals should discuss testing options with their physicians. Treatment of Chagas disease can be difficult, and drugs are available only through the CDC after consultation with a physician.</p>
                    
                    <h2>CANINE HEALTH<span>Impacts</span></h2>
                    <p>In dogs, infection with the Chagas parasite can cause severe heart disease, however many infected dogs may remain asymptomatic. There is variation in the degree of complications from Chagas disease that likely relate to the age of the dog, the activity level of the dog, and the genetic strain of the parasite. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities and sudden death may occur, as well as bloat due to reduced cardiac function and inability to properly pump fluids throughout the body.  The most common test for canine Chagas disease is a blood test called the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test.  IFA does not test for infection with the parasite, bur rather tests for antibodies to the <em>T. cruzi</em> parasite.  A positive result indicates that the dog has been exposed at some time in past.  Testing for canine Chagas disease is available through the <a class="fancyLink" href="http://tvmdl.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory</a>. Unfortunately, treatment options are not readily available, although some research teams are developing new treatment approaches that are promising. There is currently no vaccination that protects against Chagas disease for either dogs or humans. Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University documented Chagas disease in domestic dogs throughout many counties in Texas. [PHOTO: “KjosMap.tiff”  CAPTION: This study documented 537 cases of canine Chagas disease in 48 counties in Texas, from 1993-2007.  As from Kjos et al., 2008, Veterinary Parsitology, 152: 249-256.] As awareness of Chagas disease grows and more cases are confirmed, we can expect many more counties to be added to the current map.</p>
                    
                    <h2>ENVIRONMENT<span>Life Support for the Parasite</span></h2>
                    <p>The local environment is important to the Chagas disease system.  In order for the parasite to be maintained in nature, the environment must support the reservoir, vector, and parasite, and allow interactions among them. Dog kennels are environments that may be particularly suitable for the establishment of Chagas disease transmission cycles. High densities of dogs in confined areas are associated with heat and carbon dioxide that attract kissing bugs that seek bloodmeals. Furthermore, dogs may easily consume kissing bugs in kennels. Kissing bug control can be difficult in kennels, particularly in areas where human development is relatively recent and kennels are surrounded by natural habitats where wildlife occur. Adult kissing bugs engage in nocturnal flights to search for mates and mammals for blood-feeding. Because adult bugs fly towards lights, we recommend that lights be turned off at night around kennels. Some insecticides are effective against kissing bugs when sprayed around the kennel area. However, because kissing bugs can fly in from many yards away or from nearby wildlife habitats, new colonization of treated areas can easily occur.

                <p>Citizen science offers the opportunity for non-scientists and scientists to work together to collect large amounts of data.  This project is currently seeing the help of citizen scientists (like you!) to submit carefully collected kissing bugs from Texas and throughout the U.S.  We are interested in learning more about the distribution of different species of kissing bugs, their infection prevalence over time, and their interactions with host species.  If you have come across a suspected kissing bug in or around your home, kennel, yard, or other area, we are interested in hearing about it!</p>
                <p><strong>Please do not ever touch a kissing bug with your bare hands!  The <em>T. cruzi</em> parasite occurs in the feces of kissing bugs, and their bodies may be contaminated.</strong>A glove or small plastic bag may be used to catch the bug to avoid direct contact with the bug. The bug may be stored in a sealed plastic bag, in a vial, or other small container. All surfaces with which the bug came into contact should be thoroughly cleaned with a bleach solution. </p>
                <p>Please use the form below to provide some basic information about your encounter.  If possible, please upload a photo of the bug.  There are many bugs that look similar to kissing bugs, but are different species that are not capable of transmitting the Chagas parasite. We will respond to your inquiry and provide you with further instructions on submitting your kissing bug to our Citizen Science program.  If you have a kissing bug that is known to have bit a human, please contact your <a class="fancyLink" href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu/health/zoonosis/contact/" target="_blank">regional Zoonosis Control officer</a> or fill out the form above and we can put you in contact with the state health department.</p>

                <p>Our research team combines experts in veterinary medicine, parasitology, entomology, ecology, and public health. We are taking a ‘One Health’ approach to study the ecology and epidemiology of Chagas disease in the southern US. With this approach, we are combining studies of vector populations, wildlife reservoirs, domestic dogs, parasite genetic strains, laboratory animals, and human risk.  There are many researchers across Texas A&amp;M University and other institutions in Texas that we work with who have expertise on different aspects of Chagas disease.  Here, meet the team focused on this Citizen Science campaign and Kissing Bug collections across the state.</p>
                <ul id="teamTask">
                    <li>We are engaged in field collections of kissing bugs using diverse trapping techniques across private and public lands.</li>
                    <li>We have established a state-wide public outreach effort through which we are inviting citizens to submit kissing bugs to our laboratory for identification and testing. This ‘citizen science’ approach is allowing us to obtain samples from many ecoregions of the state and has broadened the impact of our research.</li>
                    <li>We are educating veterinarians and physicians to be aware of Chagas disease and its status in Texas. </li>
                    <li>Our wildlife studies involve capture/release live-trapping of diverse small mammal species and solicitation of blood and tissue samples from hunter-harvested wild animals</li>
                    <li>We have established a network of seven animal shelters in the state, and we are assessing the burden of Chagas disease in shelter dogs to provide an index of local risk.</li>
                    <li>In the laboratory, we are identifying bugs to the species level and testing bugs and wildlife samples for T. cruzi. We are particularly interested in using genetic approaches to determine the strains of parasite that circulate in different regions, because different strains are associated with different disease outcomes in humans and animals.</li>

                <div class="qacontainer">
                    <div class="question"><p>What are kissing bugs?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>Kissing bugs are insects that may be infected with <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em>, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. They are commonly known as cone-nose bugs or chinches. Kissing bugs feed on blood during the night, and they are called kissing bugs because they prefer to bite humans around the mouth or eyes.</p></div>

                <div class="qacontainer">
                    <div class="question"><p>What do kissing bugs in the U.S look like?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>Adult kissing bugs range from about ¾ - 1 ¼ inches in length..  Most species have a very characteristic band around the edge of the body that is striped with orange or red markings. One species (<em>Triatoma protracta</em>) may or may not have a single colored band around the outer edge of the body.
The legs of kissing bugs are long and thin.  Unlike some other species, the legs are uniformly thin along the length of the leg, and there are no ‘bulging’ thicker areas on the legs.  
Kissing bugs have distinctive mouthparts that appear as a large black extension to the head.  These mouthparts give rise to the nickname ‘Cone-nose bug’.</p>
                    <p>There are 11 different species of kissing bugs in United States. The most common species in the south-central United States are Triatoma sanguisuga and Triatoma gerstaeckeri, which are each about 1 inch long.</p>

                    <div class="answer"><p>Kissing bugs are found throughout the Americas. In the US, kissing bugs are established in <a class="fancyLink" href="http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/vectors/index.html" target="_blank">28 states</a>. A total of 11 different species of kissing bugs have been documented in the US, with the highest diversity and density in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p></div>

                    <div class="question"><p>What percent of kissing bugs carry the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>The parasite <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> can live in the digestive system of the kissing bug. Our research has found that over 50% of kissing bugs submitted by the public from across Texas are infected with the parasite that causes Chagas disease.</p></div>

                    <div class="question"><p>What should I do if I found a kissing bug?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>Never touch a kissing bug with a bare hand. The parasite they may harbor can be transmitted to humans and other animals. If you see a bug you believe is a kissing bug and would like confirmation of the species identity and to submit it for testing, our lab accepts carefully obtained samples. 
A glove or small plastic bag may be used to catch the bug to avoid direct contact with the bug. The bug may be stored in a sealed plastic bag, in a vial, or other small container. All surfaces with which the bug came into contact should be thoroughly cleaned with a bleach solution.</p>

                    <div class="question"><p>How can humans and animals acquire Chagas disease?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>The insect vector, commonly known as the kissing bug, can transmit the parasite to hosts by biting and subsequently defecating near the site of the bite.  Bugs can enter homes, hunting cabins, dog kennels, or other areas where they may find hosts on which to feed. Dogs can also become infected through the consumption of infected bugs. Additionally, the parasite can be transmitted congenitally, through blood transfusion, and through transplantation of infected organs.</p></div>

                <div class="qacontainer">
                    <div class="question"><p>Can other animals become infected with Trypanosoma cruzi?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>Many of the species of animals upon which kissing bugs feed can serve as a source of parasite infection to the bug, and the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite has been found to infect domestic dogs, humans, opossums, woodrats, armadillos, coyotes, mice, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Wildlife are responsible for maintaining this parasite in nature.  Therefore, Chagas disease emerges at the intersection of wildlife, domestic animals, humans, and vector populations.</p></div>

                <div class="qacontainer">
                    <div class="question"><p>What is Chagas disease?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>The parasite <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (picture) causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and other mammals.
In humans, Chagas disease manifests in two phases: acute phase and chronic phase. After becoming infected with the parasite, the acute phase can last for a few weeks or months. This phase can be symptom-free or difficult to diagnose because the <a class="fancyLink" href="http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/" target="_blank">symptoms</a> are common for many types of sicknesses, including fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. Of those who are infected with the parasite, approximately 30% are at risk of developing chronic Chagas disease. Chronic Chagas disease includes cardiac complications and/or intestinal complications, and these signs may not be apparent until decades after the initial infection. Cardiac signs include enlarged heart, heart failure, altered heart rate, and/or cardiac arrest. Intestinal signs include an enlarged esophagus or colon, which can cause difficulties with digestion. Concerned individuals should discuss testing options with their physicians. Treatment of Chagas disease can be difficult, and drugs are available only through the CDC after consultation with a physician.</p></div>

                    <div class="question"><p>How does the kissing bug spread the parasite that causes Chagas disease?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>The insect vector, commonly known as the kissing bug (picture), can transmit the parasite to hosts by biting and subsequently defecating near the site of the bite. The parasites live in the digestive tract of the bugs and are shed in the bug feces. When infectious bug fecal material contaminates the mucous membranes or the site of bug bite on a mammal, transmission of the parasite can occur.</p></div>

                <div class="qacontainer">
                    <div class="question"><p>Where is Chagas disease found?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>Chagas disease is endemic throughout central and South America, and is increasingly recognized as both a human and veterinary health concern in the southern United States. Chagas disease became a reportable disease in Texas in 2013.
The public health burden of Chagas disease in the US is largely unknown, because most states are not required to keep track of the number of confirmed human cases. Estimates of human cases of Chagas disease in the US range from 300,000 to over 1 million, with particular concern for those living in the US/Mexico border regions. In addition to documented cases in immigrants who were infected in central and South America, there are increasing reports of human cases of Chagas disease acquired in the United States.

                <div class="qacontainer">
                   <div class="question"><p>How does Chagas disease affect dogs?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>In dogs, infection with the Chagas parasite can cause severe heart disease, however many infected dogs may remain asymptomatic. There is variation in the degree of complications that likely relate to the age of the dog, the activity level of the dog, and the genetic strain of the parasite. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities and sudden death may occur, as well as ascites due to reduced cardiac function and inability to properly pump fluids throughout the body. Testing for canine Chagas disease is in the form of a blood test, and is available through the <a class="fancyLink" href="http://tvmdl.tamu.edu/tests_services/test_info.php?test=Chagas-6---Trypanosoma-cruzi-(IFA)&unit_id=1972&unit_effdt=2014-01-09" target="_blank">Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory</a>.  Blood is screened for antibodies to the <em>T. cruzi</em> parasite, and a positive result indicates that the dog has been exposed at some time in past. Unfortunately, treatment options are not readily available, although some research teams are developing new treatment approaches that are promising. There is currently no vaccination that protects against Chagas disease for either dogs or humans. A recent veterinary study documented Chagas disease in domestic dogs throughout many counties in Texas. As awareness of Chagas disease grows and more cases are confirmed, we can expect many more counties to be added to the current map.</p></div>

                    <div class="question"><p>Why are dogs at risk of being infected?</p></div>
                    <div class="answer"><p>Dog kennels are environments that may be particularly suitable for the establishment of Chagas disease transmission cycles. High densities of dogs in confined areas are associated with heat and carbon dioxide that attract kissing bugs that seek bloodmeals. Furthermore, dogs may easily consume kissing bugs in kennels. Kissing bug control can be difficult in kennels, particularly in areas where human development is relatively recent and kennels are surrounded by natural habitats where wildlife occur.   Adult kissing bugs engage in nocturnal flights to search for mates and mammals for blood-feeding. Because adult bugs fly towards lights, we recommend that lights be turned off at night around kennels. Some insecticides are effective against kissing bugs when sprayed around the kennel area. However, because kissing bugs can fly in from many yards away or from nearby wildlife habitats, new colonization of treated areas can easily occur.</p></div>
