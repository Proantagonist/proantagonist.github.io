                    <p>	Our research team combines experts in veterinary medicine, parasitology, entomology, ecology, and public health. We are taking a ‘One Health’ approach to study the ecology and epidemiology of Chagas disease in the southern US. With this approach, we are combining studies of vector populations, wildlife reservoirs, domestic dogs, parasite genetic strains, laboratory animals, and human risk.</p>
                    <article>
                        <li>We are engaged in field collections of kissing bugs using diverse trapping techniques across private and public lands.</li>
                        <li>We have established a state-wide public outreach effort through which we are inviting citizens to submit kissing bugs to our laboratory for identification and testing. This ‘citizen science’ approach is allowing us to obtain samples from many ecoregions of the state and has broadened the impact of our research.</li>
                        <li>We are educating veterinarians and physicians to be aware of Chagas disease and its status in Texas.</li>
                        <li>Our wildlife studies involve capture/release live-trapping of diverse small mammal species and solicitation of blood and tissue samples from hunter-harvested wild animals.</li>
                        <li>We have established a network of seven animal shelters in the state, and we are assessing the burden of Chagas disease in shelter dogs to provide an index of local risk.</li>
                        <li>In the laboratory, we are identifying bugs to the species level and testing bugs and wildlife samples for T. cruzi. We are particularly interested in using genetic approaches to determine the strains of parasite that circulate in different regions, because different strains are associated with different disease outcomes in humans and animals.</li>
                        <li>We are complementing our studies of natural populations in the field with an experimental model of animal infection using mice in the laboratory. These studies are broadly ecological in nature, focusing on the interaction of species in their natural environments. We expect that our data will provide critical information useful in efforts to predict and reduce T. cruzi infection in human and animal populations.</li>

	               <p>If you are interested in submitting kissing bugs for testing, we are currently accepting carefully collected and well-labeled samples from diverse geographic areas across the southern US. Prior to submission, please email us so we may provide details on safe collection methods and shipping instructions. We look forward to developing strong relationships with dog owners throughout Texas and the southern US to better understand the ecology and epidemiology of Chagas disease as a critical prerequisite for the development of treatments, vaccinations, and risk reduction measures. </p>

                        <div class="question"><p>What are kissing bugs?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Kissing bugs are insects that may be infected with <em>Trypanosoma Cruzi</em>, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. They are commonly known as cone-nose bugs or chinches. Kissing bugs feed on blood during the night, and they are called kissing bugs because they prefer to bite humans around the mouth or eyes.</p></div>

                    <div class="qacontainer">
                        <div class="question"><p>What do kissing bugs in the U.S look like?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Adult kissing bugs range from about ¾ - 1 ¼ inches in length.  Most species have very characteristic stripes around the edge of the body; one species (<em>Triatoma protracta</em>) may or may not have a single colored band around the outer edge of the body.
The legs of kissing bugs are long and thin.  Unlike some other species, the legs are uniformly thin along the length of the leg, and there are no ‘bulging’ thicker areas on the legs.  
The antennae are attached very close to the tip of the head</p></div>

                        <div class="question"><p>Where are kissing bugs found?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Kissing bugs are found throughout the Americas. In the US, kissing bugs are established in 28 states (picture). A total of 11 different species of kissing bugs have been documented in the US, with the highest diversity and density in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p></div>

                        <div class="question"><p>What percent of kissing bugs carry the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>The parasite <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> can live in the digestive system of the kissing bug. Previous studies have found that in Texas, on average, 50% of kissing bugs are infected with the parasite that causes Chagas disease.</p></div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="question"><p>What should I do if I found a kissing bug?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Never touch a kissing bug with a bare hand. The parasite they may harbor can be transmitted to humans and other animals. If you see a bug you believe is a kissing bug and would like confirmation of the species identity and to submit it for testing, our lab accepts carefully obtained samples. 
A glove or small plastic bag may be used to catch the bug to avoid direct contact with the bug. The bug may be stored in a sealed plastic bag, in a vial, or other small container. All surfaces with which the bug came into contact should be thoroughly cleaned with a bleach solution. You may <a href="#contact" class="fancyLink">contact us</a> with questions or about submitting a kissing bug. 
Please write down the following information to submit with the bug, since it is very important for us to know:</p>
                                <li>exactly where the bug was found</li>
                                <li>the date</li>
                                <li>the time of day</li> 
                                <li>if the bug was alive when found</li>
                                <li>what the bug was doing</li>

                        <div class="question"><p>How can humans and animals acquire Chagas disease?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>The insect vector, commonly known as the kissing bug, can transmit the parasite to hosts by biting and subsequently defecating near the site of the bite.  While this ‘vector-fecal’ transmission route is thought to be the most common mode of transmission for humans, dogs can also become infected through the consumption of infected bugs. Additionally, the parasite can be transmitted congenitally, through blood transfusion, and through transplantation of infected organs.</p></div>

                        <div class="question"><p>Can other animals become infected with Trypanosoma cruzi?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Many of the species of animals upon which kissing bugs feed can serve as a source of parasite infection to the bug, and the <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> parasite has been found to infect domestic dogs, humans, opossums, woodrats, armadillos, coyotes, mice, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Therefore, Chagas disease emerges at the intersection of wildlife, domestic animals, humans, and vector populations.</p></div>

                    <div class="qacontainer">
                        <div class="question"><p>What is Chagas disease?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>The parasite <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (picture) causes Chagas disease in humans, dogs, and other mammals.
In humans, Chagas disease manifests in two phases: acute phase and chronic phase. After becoming infected with the parasite, the acute phase can last for a few weeks or months. This phase can be symptom-free or difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are common for many types of sicknesses, including fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/" target="_blank" class="fancyLink">Source</a>). Of those who are infected with the parasite, approximately 30% are at risk of developing chronic Chagas disease. Chronic Chagas disease includes cardiac complications and/or intestinal complications, and these signs may not be apparent until decades after the initial infection. Cardiac signs include enlarged heart, heart failure, altered heart rate, and/or cardiac arrest. Intestinal signs include an enlarged esophagus or colon, which can cause difficulties with digestion. Concerned individuals should discuss testing options with their physicians. Treatment of Chagas disease can be difficult, and drugs are available only through the CDC after consultation with a physician. </p></div>

                        <div class="question"><p>How does the kissing bug spread the parasite that causes Chagas disease?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>The insect vector, commonly known as the kissing bug (picture), can transmit the parasite to hosts by biting and subsequently defecating near the site of the bite. The parasites live in the digestive tract of the bugs and are shed in the bug feces. When infectious bug fecal material contaminates the mucous membranes or the site of bug bite on a mammal, transmission of the parasite can occur.</p></div>

                        <div class="question"><p>Where is Chagas disease found?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Chagas disease is endemic throughout central and South America, and is increasingly recognized as both a human and veterinary health concern in the southern US. Chagas disease became a reportable disease in Texas in 2013.
The public health burden of Chagas disease in the US is largely unknown, because most states are not required to keep track of the number of confirmed human cases. Estimates of human cases of Chagas disease in the US range from 300,000 to over 1 million, with particular concern for those living in the US/Mexico border regions. In addition to documented cases in immigrants who were infected in central and South America, there are increasing reports of human cases of Chagas disease acquired in the US.</p></div>

                    <div class="qacontainer">
                       <div class="question"><p>How does Chagas disease affect dogs?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>In dogs, infection with the Chagas parasite can cause severe heart disease, however many infected dogs may remain asymptomatic. There is variation in the degree of complications that likely relate to the age of the dog, the activity level of the dog, and the genetic strain of the parasite. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities and sudden death may occur, as well as ascites due to reduced cardiac function and inability to properly pump fluids throughout the body. Testing for canine Chagas disease is in the form of a blood test, and is available through the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (<a href="http://tvmdl.tamu.edu/tests_services/test_info.php?test=Chagas-6---Trypanosoma-cruzi-(IFA)&unit_id=1972&unit_effdt=2014-01-09" class="fancyLink" target="_blank">Source</a>).  Blood is screened for antibodies to the T. cruzi parasite, and a positive result indicates that the dog has been exposed at some time in past. Unfortunately, treatment options are not readily available, although some research teams are developing new treatment approaches that are promising. There is currently no vaccination that protects against Chagas disease for either dogs or humans. A recent veterinary study documented Chagas disease in domestic dogs throughout many counties in Texas (picture). As awareness of Chagas disease grows and more cases are confirmed, we can expect many more counties to be added to the current map.</p></div>

                        <div class="question"><p>Why are dogs at risk of being infected?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Dog kennels are environments that may be particularly suitable for the establishment of Chagas disease transmission cycles. High densities of dogs in confined areas are associated with heat and carbon dioxide that attract kissing bugs that seek bloodmeals. Furthermore, dogs may easily consume kissing bugs in kennels. Kissing bug control can be difficult in kennels, particularly in areas where human development is relatively recent and kennels are surrounded by natural habitats where wildlife occur.   Adult kissing bugs engage in nocturnal flights to search for mates and mammals for blood-feeding. Because adult bugs fly towards lights, we recommend that lights be turned off at night around kennels. Some insecticides are effective against kissing bugs when sprayed around the kennel area. However, because kissing bugs can fly in from many yards away or from nearby wildlife habitats, new colonization of treated areas can easily occur.</p></div>

                        <div class="answer"><p>Kissing bugs develop onto adults after a series of immature life stages called nymphs (picture), and both nymphs and adults engage in bloodfeeding behavior. Bugs feed on diverse wild and domestic animals including wild rodents, other wild mammals, and domestic dogs.
There are 11 different species of kissing bugs in United States. The most common species in the south-central US are <em>Triatoma sanguisuga</em> (picture) and <em>Triatoma gerstaeckeri</em> (picture), which are each about 1 inch long. 
Kissing bugs are members of the Reduviidae family of insects. Other reduviids that are similar in appearance (see examples at the 'non-kissing bug' page)feed on plants and other insects and can inflict a painful bite when disturbed, however only kissing bugs are known to transmit the Chagas parasite.
