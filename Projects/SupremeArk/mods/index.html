            <div class="column9">
                <p>The following list of mods has been carefully been selected and curated through extensive research and community feedback. The overall goal of the mods is to extend the functionality of the existing mechanics without going too far over the top with mods such as Annunaki. Some features of the installed mods have been removed in to preserve the intended sense of risk and thrill.</p>


                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>Player and Dino Levels</h4>

                <p>Players have the ability to reach level 301 at 1,500,000 XP. The first hundred levels are easy, intended to help players get out of that grind zone, but quickly ramps up afterwards. It takes a very dedicated player several days to get to max level, so while there is a 25x XP multiplier do not expect it to be a complete walk in the park.</p>

                <p>The max dino wild level is 150, and can gain an additional 100 levels after taming through training at 1000,000 XP.</p>


                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>Custom Supply Loot Crates</h4>

                <p>On your mark. Get set, Go! The loot table on both maps has been redefined and tweaked in order to make supply and cave drops worth hunting. In these you will find armors and weapons of differing qualities as well as resources, and rare holiday skins. For any item, there is a 12.5% (20% in cave and deep sea crates) chance of receiving a blueprint.</p>


                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>ORP2 - Offline Raid Protection</h4>

                <p>In order to discourage griefers and chronic offline raiders, this mod offer a craftable pillar which can be placed anywhere in your base. Its function is to increase the health of your structures and tamed dinos, as well as increasing the melee of your dinos while you are offline. While it is not impossible to raid someone when ORP is active, it makes it slightly more challenging and will take more time to get through your defenses. <strong>Making an ORP pillar should be a newcomer's first priority!</strong></p>

                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>StackMeMore</h4>

                <p>A simple yet very useful mod that compliments the server's accelerated gathering rates.</p>

                <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680481868" target="_blank">View the Steam Workshop Page</a>




                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>Ark Advance</h4>

                <p>An entire suite of craftable items from better, smaller, portable forges to the beloved X-arrow. This mod also provides its own form of glass structures but we highly recommend you use the S+ glass from the Structures Plus mod. The X-darts have been disabled due to ridiculous torpor deliveries. However, the X-arrow remains which deals a modest amount of torpor while webbing the victim. They are unlockable at level 175 for a cost of 5000 engram points. Save up and spend your engram points wisely! This mod also includes a pantry which is particularly for spoiling meat at an accelerated rate. All Ark Advance items originate from the Advance Crafting Station, with some requiring an additional crafting station such as cooking structures.</p>

                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>Structures Plus</h4>

                <p>Building materials as it should be. Better snap points, glass structures, ability to pick up structures and more. Gets rid of all the frustration that comes with building with vanilla structures. While it's possible to make the vanilla structures, we recommend players use the S+ structures from the get-go.</p>

                <p>This mod also includes an S+ version of crafting stations which allow resource pulling from neighboring containers. No more running back and forth from one crafting station to another trying to find supplies. Access the resource pulling dialog by long-pressing "E".</p>

                <h4>Raft Extender</h4>

                <p>Not really a land person? Build a moving base! This mod increases the number of structures allowed on a raft to 2000 total structures and adds a reverse function. See the referenced video in the workshop page on how to extend the platform horizontally.</p>

                <h4>Color Blind Friendly Supply</h4>

                <p>Recolors the supply drop beams in order to make the colors more conspicuous especially in bright backgrounds where the vanilla beams would have been confused due to their unsaturated colors.</p>

                <div class="separator"></div>

                <h4>Improved Spyglass</h4>

                <p>Offers two types of glasses, the binoglass and the omnicular. The Binoglass is the vanilla spyglass plus a few levels of zoom and a circular cross hair The omniglass spots all dinos in its direct field of vision. In addition, the omnicular can open and close doors as well as cycle their state based on a timer. Useful for opening behemoth gates without having to worry about closing them manually. Range is limited.</p>
